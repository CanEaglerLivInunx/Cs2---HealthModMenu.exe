# Cs2---HealthModMenu.exe

CS2 Health Mod Menu is a simple tool that adds an "Infinite Health" toggle for Counter-Strike 2.
When activated, it prevents you from dying for one full round, effectively making you invincible for that duration.
To use it, run the .exe file and press the designated button at the start of each round.
The effect lasts until the round ends, and must be reactivated each time.

This mod is intended for educational or private use only. It is not suitable for use in official or VAC-protected servers, as it may result in a ban. Use at your own risk.
